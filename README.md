## why i choice gitbook

I use markdown to write my note long time. And ever create a site which use javascript to translate .md to .html, help me to orgnize my note. But file tree is too complex than gitbook.     
So finally i choice gitbook to manage my note. And gitbook have numerous programmers maintain it.
I only need to program a bit of tool which let sys auto build my `SUMMARY.md` and auto deploy to my site when ```git push```.No more action, just write my note, focus my article. Good!
